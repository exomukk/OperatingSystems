Yes, a thread can call fork() to create a new process.

Parent of the new process:

The new process created by the thread using fork() will have the entire process (containing that thread) as its parent.
In other words, the parent of the new process is the process in which the thread that called fork() is running, not just the thread itself.
After the fork(), the child process will have a single thread, which is a copy of the thread that invoked the fork() in the parent process.
