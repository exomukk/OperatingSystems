If the entire process is swapped out from main memory to external memory (i.e., swapped to disk), the following happens to its threads:

All threads are suspended:

Since threads cannot execute without their associated process being in memory, all 3 threads (the one in the running state and the two in the ready queue) will be suspended.
Swapping includes the thread states:

The states (running or ready) of the threads will be saved so that when the process is swapped back into memory, these threads can resume execution.
Thread management continues, but no execution:

The operating system will still keep track of these threads (in the process control block and thread control block), but they will not be scheduled for execution while the process is swapped out.
When swapped back in:

Once the process is swapped back into memory, the two threads in the ready queue will become eligible to run again, and the running thread can resume execution from where it was swapped out.
