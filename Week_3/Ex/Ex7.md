When you execute the command ls -l in a Ubuntu command line interpreter (shell), several processes happen in the kernel and user space. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what occurs:

1. Command Parsing:
The shell receives the command ls -l as input.
It parses the command to determine the program to execute (ls) and its arguments (-l).
2. Path Resolution:
The shell looks for the executable file for ls in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
The shell may search through several directories (e.g., /bin, /usr/bin, etc.) until it finds the ls executable.
3. Process Creation:
The shell uses the fork() system call to create a new process. This new process is a child of the shell process.
The kernel creates a new process control block (PCB) for the child process, copying certain attributes from the parent (e.g., process state, open file descriptors).
4. Executable Loading:
The child process uses the exec() family of functions (e.g., execv, execve) to replace its memory space with the ls program.
The kernel loads the executable into memory, sets up the execution environment, and prepares for execution. This includes setting up the stack, heap, and data segments.
5. Argument Passing:
The arguments (in this case, -l) are passed to the ls program.
The kernel sets up the argument stack for the ls process.
6. Execution:
The kernel transfers control to the ls executable.
The ls program executes, performing the requested action of listing directory contents.
7. Handling the -l Option:
The ls program processes the -l option, which requests a "long" format output. This includes additional details about each file (permissions, owner, size, modification time, etc.).
8. File System Interaction:
The ls command interacts with the file system via system calls (e.g., opendir(), readdir(), stat()).
The kernel handles these calls, providing the necessary data about files and directories to the ls program.
9. Output Generation:
The ls program formats the retrieved information according to the -l option and sends this output to the standard output (stdout).
This output usually goes to the terminal (tty) unless redirected.
10. Process Termination:
Once ls finishes executing, it returns an exit status to the kernel.
The kernel updates the process status to "terminated" and cleans up resources associated with the ls process (e.g., closing file descriptors, releasing memory).
11. Returning to the Shell:
The shell regains control, and you are returned to the command prompt.
The shell can then check the exit status of the ls command to determine if it completed successfully.
